# Foam for Gollum

Foam for Gollum is a fork of [Foam](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/), which adds support for Gollum-style wikilinks: `[[Alias|Page Name]]`.

These are the options and their defaults:

```
"foam.wikilinks.syntax": "gollum",
"foam.wikilinks.case-insensitive": true
```

It's best to add the above setting to workspace settings in the case you have multiple repositories with different notations.

Please refer to [Foam documentation](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/) for the full description of features.
